Over the past few months, Framer Motion went from being a fun tool I played with on the side to a core element of my frontend projects when it comes to adding a layer of interaction to my UIs. I went **from knowing almost nothing about animations and transitions**, to being able [to orchestrate more complex animations](https://twitter.com/MaximeHeckel/status/1327647479521701889?s=20) involving lots of elements.

I've shared a lot of the animation work I sprinkled throughout my blog on Twitter, and a lot of you have asked me to share more code snippets. Thus I felt it was time for a little write-up!

In this post, you'll find **a condensed guide containing everything I've learned when it comes to Framer Motion**, the key concepts of animation, and how to use this library to create animations that spark joy **through some interactive examples and widgets**.

<callout-info>
  To illustrate the concepts we will see in this blog post, which are very visual, **I included a series of editable code snippets/playgrounds and widgets** to allow you to try out some of the core features of Framer Motion within the article itself! The aim was to help the reader understand the concepts by applying them, tweaking some code, visualizing examples.

Regarding the interactive code snippets: You can **edit the code to tweak the animation** at will, and **see the resulting animation on the left pane** (top if you're on mobile).

Let me know what you think of these examples and whether you've learned these Framer Motion concepts faster by doing!
